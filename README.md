FlutterEcom is a modern e-commerce mobile application built with Flutter, designed to provide a seamless shopping experience. It features robust user authentication, a dynamic product catalog, detailed product views, and a functional shopping cart, all powered by the BLoC state management pattern for a clean and scalable architecture.

## 🎯 Key Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration flows with input validation.
*   **Splash Screen:** Initial loading screen with token-based navigation to home or login.
*   **Product Listing:** Browse a variety of products on the dashboard with a responsive grid view.
*   **Product Details:** View comprehensive information about individual products, including description, specifications, and reviews.
*   **Shopping Cart:** Add products to the cart, view cart items, and manage quantities (initial implementation).
*   **User Profile Management:** View and manage user profile details.
*   **State Management:** Utilizes the BLoC pattern for predictable and maintainable state handling.
*   **API Integration:** Communicates with a backend API for data fetching and updates.
*   **Local Storage:** Uses `shared_preferences` to persist user authentication tokens.
*   **Interactive UI:** Features like carousel sliders for banners and animated components (Lottie animations).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project adopts a BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture combined with a Repository pattern, promoting a clear separation of concerns and testability.

```mermaid

    UI(User Interface: Pages/Widgets) --> B(BLoC: Business Logic);
    B --> R(Repository: Data Abstraction);
    R --> APIH(API Helper: Network Requests);
    APIH --> DS(Data Source: API Endpoints);
    DS --> M(Models: Data Structures);
    M --> APIH;
    APIH --> R;
    R --> B;
    B --> UI;
    UI -.-> LS(Local Storage: Shared Preferences);
    LS -.-> B;
```

**Flow Explanation:**

1.  **User Interaction (UI):** When a user performs an action (e.g., clicks login, fetches products), the UI dispatches an `Event` to the corresponding `BLoC`.
2.  **BLoC (Business Logic):** The BLoC receives the `Event`, processes the business logic (e.g., validates input, prepares data), and then calls the appropriate method in the `Repository`. It also manages the state of the UI by emitting different `States` (e.g., Loading, Success, Failure).
3.  **Repository (Data Abstraction):** The Repository acts as an abstraction layer for data sources. It decides whether to fetch data from a remote API via `ApiHelper` or from local storage (e.g., `shared_preferences`). It transforms raw data into application-specific `Models`.
4.  **API Helper (Network Requests):** This component is responsible for making actual HTTP requests to the backend `Data Source` (defined by `AppUrls`). It handles request headers (including authentication tokens from `Shared Preferences`), request bodies, and error handling for network communication.
5.  **Models (Data Structures):** Define the structure of data received from or sent to the API, ensuring type safety and easy manipulation within the application.
6.  **State Update (UI):** Once the BLoC receives data back from the Repository, it emits a new `State` (e.g., `LoginSuccessState`, `ProductSuccessState`). The UI listens to these states and rebuilds itself accordingly, displaying the fetched data or error messages.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

*   [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version `3.8.0` or higher)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
*   A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cybersleuth0/ShopSphere.git
    cd ShopSphere
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    *(Note: This project requires a backend API for full functionality. Ensure your API is running and configured correctly in `lib/utils/constants/app_urls.dart` if it's not already pointing to a public endpoint.)*
